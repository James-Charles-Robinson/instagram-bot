## Limitations
1. Can be quite a slow way of gettings followers, with standard settings expect 5/10 followers per hour run
2. Only works well if ran on an old account, anything less then 3 months will probably get action blocked
3. Doesnt leave comments on posts
4. If you're to aggressive with settings, such as using a too litle wait time, then your account may get banned. Although this hasn't happened to me
